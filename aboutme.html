        <b>BHARATH KUAMR REDDY MOPURU</b><br>
        I completed my bachlores in Mechanical engineering but reason of choosing ACS is 
        interest in programming languages. This is got from when I first encoutered with C 
        language in my First year of my bachlors, but at that time I had no option of changing 
        stream and  now it is an greate opportunity to study some programming stuff 
        that,s why I choose computer science  as my majors.

        This movie was released in this year itself.I watched this movie in prasad Imax in Tamil though the language 
        is not so familiar but the feal that I got from Tamil and Tamil audience is in different level even though I saw it twice in Telugu.
        Director Lokesh Kanagaraj's movie taking and the action scenes are topnotch. Acting by all the three lead actors 
        taken the movie to next level. My personal favorite thing was Vijay sethupati's entry and the cute mature love story
        between fahad and his wife in the movie. In the end, Suriya sir's cameo appearence is another big highlight.
        Not to forgot  <b> Rolex sir.</b>
